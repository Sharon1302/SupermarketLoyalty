import pandas as pd

 Load the training and testing datasets
train = pd.read_csv("train.csv")
test = pd.read_csv("test.csv")

#  Fit the baseline model by calculating the average spend from the training data
baseline_spend = train['spend'].mean()

#  Prepare the result dataframe for test data
base_result = test[['customer_id']].copy()
base_result['spend'] = baseline_spend

#Output the result for verification
print(base_result.head())

# The resulting DataFrame 'base_result' contains customer_id and the predicted spend for each customer
